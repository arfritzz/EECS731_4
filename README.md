# EECS731_4
Major Leagues


The goal of this project was to take data from the NFL and fit a regression model. 

I tried both linear regression and random forest regression. 

Linear regression overfit the data and random forest regression gave a cross-validation score of around 0.5. I used the random forest model to write a predict function to predict the score of the two teams.
