Here's the data. I got it from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/nfl-elo-game/blob/master/data/nfl_games.csv. 

The columns are self explainatory and are 
- date 
- season 
- neutral 
- playoff 
- team1 
- team2 
- elo1
- elo2 
- elo_prob1 
- score1
- score2 
- result1 

The elo1 and elo2 are the probability that a team will win according to the ELO model. 
elo_prob1 is the probability that team1 will win based on the ELO model.
